# flag-master

Flag Master works with both Channel Entries and Comments and can be set to auto close items based on flag count.

Flag Master works off of a Profile mechanism so there can be unlimited variety for each and every item within your site. Create a unique set of Flag options for Blogs, another for Blog Comments, and another for Product Ratings. Itâ€™s easy and simple.

Flag Master includes a custom FieldType for inclusion on Channel Entries so Flags can be viewed on a per entry basis.
